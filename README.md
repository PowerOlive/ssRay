# ssRay

ssRay is an unbiased Monte Carlo path tracing renderer capable of producing very realistic looking images. Images are generated by shooting billions of rays into the scene and letting them bounce based on physical laws. ssRay is written in C++ and currently runs only on Linux. ssRay supports diffuse materials as well as glass and mirror like materials with varying IOR or roughness. No SDL support is implemented. Currently the project is on hiatus.

## Features

- global illumination
- shadows from indirect lighting
- real depth of field modeling
- kd-tree acceleration with SAH
- basic transformations (translate, rotate, scale)

## Sample images

These dragons demonstrate different materials and how kd-trees make it possible to render huge meshes.
